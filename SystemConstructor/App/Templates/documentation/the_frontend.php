<h3 class="display-4">The Front End</h3>

<p>

    <big>
        We tried to make the development of the front end simpler and easy. To understand
        the development of the front end you should you should understand the term template.
        Template is the a php file which can be written using php, html, java script and
        Cascade Style Sheet. A template can be web page or header or footer for collection
        of other templates. A template can only be created inside Templates folder. You can
        create a folder inside the Templates folder and create your template inside the
        newly created folder. The navigation of this kind of template will be discussed
        later on this document.
