    <h3 class="display-4">From Developers</h3>

    <big>
        This simple framework is developed for the developer who wants to develop their project using
        php simply other than using more complex frameworks. this means to use this framework you donâ€™t
        need to know another programming language like other php frameworks. I my-self choose not to learn
        another programming language other than php to develop software using php framework. <br> <br>
        The framework can be used to develop back end and the front end. It also can be used to develop
        rest API. line can make the API for you if you want to use the default API of the framework.
        The default API is not fully finished yet but it will be discussed on another chapter on this
        document. You can use the default API for only read purpose if you want. <br> <br>
        Through time there are many things that should be updated in line. By using this version of line
        framework, you will not have that kind of applicability because there is no updater for this
        version (version 1.0) but we are working updater for the next versions.
